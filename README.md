### Hello!

You may call me Camotoy.

Currently investing my free time in Minecraft protocol work. *Very* familiar with Java, but I have experience with Python, C#, and some JavaScript.

### Projects

Look here if you're interested in my work and don't want to go through my forks!

- Geyser ([main repository](https://github.com/GeyserMC/Geyser/)/[personal repository](https://github.com/Camotoy/Geyser/))
  - Allows Minecraft Bedrock clients to connect to Minecraft Java servers.
- [BedrockSkinUtility](https://github.com/Camotoy/BedrockSkinUtility)
  - Render Minecraft Bedrock skins and capes with a Fabric mod, including custom geometry!
- [GeyserSkinManager](https://github.com/Camotoy/GeyserSkinManager)
  - Plugin addon for Geyser plugin editions to allow skins to show to Java players. 
  
  And some older projects that I've given control to others...
  
- [floodgate-skript](https://github.com/Camotoy/floodgate-skript)
  - Skript plugin for use with the [Skript](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript) scripting language and [Floodgate](https://github.com/GeyserMC/Floodgate/) Spigot plugin.
- [GeyserPreventServerSwitch](https://github.com/Camotoy/GeyserPreventServerSwitch)
  - Prevent Geyser players from joining specific servers on BungeeCord.
- [GeyserBlockJavaPlayers](https://github.com/Camotoy/GeyserBlockJavaPlayers)
  - Prevent Java players from joining a Java server - only Bedrock players are allowed!
- [GeyserBlockPlatform](https://github.com/Camotoy/GeyserBlockPlatform)
  - Prevent specific Bedrock platforms from joining with Geyser.
  
I have a Discord server that can be found at https://discord.gg/jNNC4CZtsN that contains support channels for all my plugins. Geyser support should be handled on its own Discord.
